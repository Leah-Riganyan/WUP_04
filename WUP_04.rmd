# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

The data is in the file GSScsv.csv and came from the 2018 General Social Survey.  The question to answer is to resolve this hypothesis.  
$H_0$ There is no difference between the average score on the WORDSUM test and level of schooling DEGREE  
$H_a$ There is a significant difference in average score on the WORDSUM test between at least two levels of DEGREE  

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(mydata,aes(x=DEGREE,y=WORDSUM))

basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
   
By looking at the boxplot, we can infer that the high school categories are beneath the college categories. LT High School's box is at the same level as High School. Interestingly, the top of the LT High School box would clip a bit into the Bachelor's. There is a clear statistical difference between LT High School with Junior College, and Graduate. LT High School is beneath the two.The top of High School's nearly touches Junior College's bottom line. High School's box collides greatly with Bachelor's, while being far beneath Graduate's. 
   
### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

```{r}
favstats(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=mydata)
```
   
Q1 of the Graduate's are bigger than all of the other categories. at number 10. The lowest are both High School and LT High School with 7.
   
   

## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

```{r}
model1 <- aov(WORDSUM~DEGREE,data=mydata)
summary.aov(model1)
```
    
The data shows that there is a difference somewhere in these categories.

##TukeyHSD Test

```{r}
a <- TukeyHSD(model1, conf.level=.95)
par(mar = c(3, 15.7, 2, 2))
plot(a,las=2)
```
    
The TukeyHSD test shows that LT High School and Graduate categories are statistically different, as well as LT High School and Junior College at the 95% level.
   
   
# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
   
We determined that the information we're trying to assess is categorical. We began with a boxplot, and saw a big distinction between the High School levels compared to the Graduate up levels. We then saw the numerical data which confirmed again that there was a degree of change between them all. The inferential results, however, showed that there was some difference possible. Using a TukeyHSD test, we finally see that LT Highschool and Junior College are statistically different at the 95% level.
